# Code Companion: Personalized Snippet & Helper Generator

## üí° Project Overview
**Code Companion** is a smart development assistant designed to help programmers write better, more idiomatic code, faster.  
It goes beyond simple code generation by leveraging advanced AI techniques to provide **context-aware, structured, and actionable solutions**.  

Instead of just giving you a code block, it's a tool that understands your needs and helps you integrate the solution into your workflow seamlessly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts
This project is built around four key concepts that work together to provide a powerful and unique experience:

### 1. Prompting
The user interacts with the system through natural language prompts, describing a programming task or problem they need to solve.  
It is designed to understand a wide range of requests ‚Äî from simple boilerplate to complex, task-specific queries.

### 2. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Before generating any code, the system performs a **retrieval step**.  
It searches a curated internal knowledge base of best practices, library documentation, and high-quality code examples.  
This ensures that the generated code is **correct, convention-following, and robust**.

### 3. Structured Output
The generated response is a **structured JSON object** containing:
- The code snippet
- A description
- Dependency information
- Example usage
- Important notes  

This format is designed for **easy parsing and integration** into a developer's IDE or tools.

### 4. Function Calling
The system can invoke predefined functions to perform specific actions requested by the user.  
Examples include:
- Linting code for style compliance
- Running simple tests
- Providing detailed explanations of a snippet

## üöÄ Getting Started (Planned)
While still in the planning phase, the goal is to create a simple web-based interface where you can input your prompt and receive structured output.

**Workflow:**
1. **Input:** Type your request into a text field  
   _Example:_ `"Write a Python function to read a CSV file"`
2. **Generate:** The system processes your prompt, performs RAG, and returns a structured JSON response.
3. **Output:** The result is displayed in a code editor, ready to copy and use.

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements
- **IDE Integration:** Plugins for popular IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm) for seamless usage.
- **Conversation History:** Keep a log of prompts and generated snippets for quick reference.
- **Custom Knowledge Base:** Allow users to upload their own code repositories or documentation to augment the RAG process.
